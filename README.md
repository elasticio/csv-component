# CSV Component

## Description

A component to read and write Comma Separated Values (CSV) files.

## How works

The component can read the CSV file from a remote URL or from the message
attachment. It can also write a CSV file from the incoming events.

## Requirements

## Environment variables

1. `EIO_REQUIRED_RAM_MB` - recommended value of allocated memory is `512` MB
2. `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` - HTTP request timeout in milliseconds, default value 60000
3. `REQUEST_MAX_RETRY` - number of HTTP request retry attempts, default value 3
4. `REQUEST_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`  - max size of http request in bytes, default value: 1048576

## Credentials

The component does not require credentials to function.


## Triggers

### Read CSV file from URL

This trigger will fetch the CSV file from a given URL. The address must be accessible
to the component. The fetched CSV file will be placed in the attachment part of the
outgoing message.

## Actions

### Read CSV attachment

This action will read the CSV attachment of the incoming message and output
a `JSON` object. To configure this action the following fields can be used:

*   `CSV Header` - this is a required field. Input the names of headers separated with a comma.
*   `Separators` - Specify the separator type. Usually it is a comma (`,`) but values like Semicolon (`;`), Space (` `), Tab (`\t`) and Hash (`#`) are also supported.
*   `Skip rows` - if you know that the incoming CSV file has certain number of headers you can indicate to skip them. The supported values are `None`, `First row`, `First two`, `Dirst three` and `First four`.
*   `Data columns` - here the values will be added dynamically based on the values in the `CSV Header` field. Here each data column will be listed with the name, Data Type and the Format to enable further configuration.


### Write CSV attachment

This action will combine multiple incoming events into a CSV file until there is a gap
of more than 10 seconds between events. Afterwards, the CSV file will be closed
and attached to the outgoing message.

As part of the component setup, one must specify the columns of the CSV file.
These columns will be published as the header in the first row. For each incoming
event, the value for each header will be `stringified` and written as the value
for that cell. All other properties will be ignored. For example, headers
`foo,bar` along with the following JSON events:

```
{"foo":"myfoo", "bar":"mybar"}
{"foo":"myfoo", "bar":[1,2]}
{"bar":"mybar", "baz":"mybaz"}
```

will produce the following `.csv` file:

```
foo,bar
myfoo,mybar
myfoo,"[1,2]"
,mybar
```

When columns are added in the UI, you will be presented with an opportunity to
provide a JSONata expression per column. If you require number formatting that
is specific to a locale, the JSONata expression should handle that concern.

The output of the CSV Write component will be a message with an attachment.  In
order to access this attachment, the component following the CSV Write must be
able to handle file attachments.

### Limitations

1. You may get `Component run out of memory and terminated.` error during run-time, that means that component needs more memory, please add
 `EIO_REQUIRED_RAM_MB` Environment variables for csv-component in this case.
2. Maximal possible size for attachment is 10 Mb.
3. Attachments mechanism does NOT work with  [Local Agent Installation](https://support.elastic.io/support/solutions/articles/14000076461-announcing-the-local-agent-)
